    <h3>Why Another Socket Library?</h3>

    <p>
        Why not?
        It would be good if there is a simple and elegant socket library that you can use in projects written in
        different programming languages.
    </p>

    <p>
        Mocket's programming style is heavily influenced by JavaScript.
        Programmers should be able to focus more on business logic instead of network detail when using Mocket.
    </p>

    <p>
        Mocket implements a <strong>client-server</strong> connection model.
        Mocket clients need to know the IP addresses and port number of Mocket servers.
        Mocket generally assumes each client only connect to one server but one server will maintain connections
        from multiple clients.
        However, more flexible designs are easy to achieve programmatically
    </p>

    <p>
        Mocket is <strong>event driven</strong>.
        All Mocket messages are associated with an event type as string.
        Mocket clients and servers can filter socket packages by event types.
    </p>

    <p>
        Currently, Mocket is available in following programming languages:
    </p>

    <ul id="languages">
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>and more in the future...</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them.
        You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page
        generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

    <p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to
        create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple,
        blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide
        headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and
        other advanced templating features.</p>

    <h3>How to Contribute</h3>

    <p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a
        link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub
        Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>),
        PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a
                href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
